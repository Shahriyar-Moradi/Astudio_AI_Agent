## Design Decisions
Modular Agent-Based Architecture:
The system is divided into three core agents:

TicketAnalysisAgent: Uses zero-shot classification (e.g., Facebookâ€™s BART MNLI), sentiment analysis, and summarization pipelines to analyze ticket content.
ResponseAgent: Employs text generation (e.g., GPT-2/GPT-3) to generate context-aware, personalized responses.
TicketProcessor: Orchestrates the workflow, maintains context, and handles error management.
Advanced NLP Techniques:
Leveraging modern NLP and LLM approaches allows the system to:

Dynamically classify tickets without extensive retraining.
Accurately assess sentiment and urgency.
Generate human-like, adaptive responses based on customer context.
Error Handling & Context Management:
Robust error handling and context maintenance ensure seamless end-to-end processing and scalability, with potential for further fine-tuning and continuous learning.

## Testing Approach
Unit Testing:
Each agent is independently tested to verify:

Correct ticket categorization and priority assignment.
Accurate extraction of key points and sentiment analysis.
Consistent and personalized response generation.
Edge Case Testing:
Tests cover ambiguous inputs, high-priority scenarios, and malformed tickets to ensure resilience and robustness.

Integration Testing:
The complete workflow is validated through an end-to-end test harness that processes sample tickets and verifies output correctness.

Manual Testing & Optional UI:
A basic command-line interface (or optional UI) is provided for manual testing and demonstration of system capabilities.
